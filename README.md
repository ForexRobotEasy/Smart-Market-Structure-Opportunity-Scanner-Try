# Smart Market Structure Opportunity Scanner

This code is a sample implementation of the Smart Market Structure Opportunity Scanner, developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. The purpose of this scanner is to analyze real-time forex pairs and identify potential trading opportunities based on the highest and lowest values of each pair.

## Usage Instructions

### Expert initialization function

In the `OnInit()` function, the code enables real-time forex pair analysis by calling `SymbolSelectAll(true)`. It then selects the necessary forex pairs by calling `SymbolSelect()` for each pair. The default pairs selected in this code are 'EURUSD', 'GBPUSD', and 'USDJPY', but more pairs can be added or customized as needed.

### Expert start function

In the `OnTick()` function, the code loops through all the selected forex pairs using the `SymbolsTotal()` function. For each pair, it retrieves the current symbol name, highest value, and lowest value using the `SymbolName()` and `High[]` / `Low[]` arrays respectively. It then prints the symbol, highest value, and lowest value using `Print()`.

### Expert deinitialization function

In the `OnDeinit()` function, the code disables real-time forex pair analysis by calling `SymbolSelectAll(false)`.
